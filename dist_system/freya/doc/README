### STRUCTURE ###

#### VARIABLES #####
PROJECT_INFO:
PROJECT_NAME			# Name of the project
SOURCE_DIST			# Distrubtion dir for source distrubtion
SOURCE_DIR 			# Root dir of source files (usally src or something)
ARCHIVE_ENDING			# Ending of source file
BUILD_FOLDER			# Folder Name of Folder inside source archive usally $PROJECT_NAME-$VER
DIST_FILES			# Files that are inclued in source distrubtion
#### FILES #####
dist/dist_clean			# clear files in dist/*/clean_list before building source package see below what clean_list is
dist/*/clean_list			# list with files that are not port of the source that need to remove before building source package (eg. distrubtion packages or files that where generated while building them)
dist/*				# folders with various ways of distrubtion
dist_system/usr/lib/update_source 	# script to update distrubtion sources with the latest package from source/${PROJECT_NAME}_latest${ARCHIVE_ENDING:-.tar.gz} ( distrubtion inpendent part, that will be called by update_pkg_ressources) 
dist/*/update_pkg_ressources	# script to update distrubtion sources with the latest package from source/${PROJECT_NAME}_latest${ARCHIVE_ENDING:-.tar.gz} ( distrubtion dependet part)
dist_system/usr/bin/build_all_pkgs	# builds all distrubtions that have build_pkg and update_pkg_ressources in dist/*/
dist/build_app			# script to build application in distrubtion systems (or directly in build_pkg)
dist/*/build_pkg		# build distrubtion package (optimal)
dist_system/lib/build_src	# script to build source tarball that calls dist/source_clean to clean distrubtion directory 
dist_system/etc/build_src.d/*.sh	# files that are executed by dist/source/build_src.sh to allow modifed dist clean process without modifing it
dist/source/build_src.sh	# symlink to dist_system/usr/lib/build_src, may replaced with a modifed copy of the source, but only if needed
dist/usr/lib/source_clean		# script with instructions to clean source (required, used by build_src.sh)
dist/source/source_clean	# symlink to dist_system/usr/lib/source_clean, may replaced if realy needed
dist_system/etc/source_clean.d/*.sh	# files that are executed by dist/source_clean to allow modifed dist clean process without modifing it
build_src.sh			# simlink to dist/source/build_src.sh
